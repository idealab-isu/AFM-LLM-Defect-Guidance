To mitigate this, you can implement adaptive or region-specific gain tuning—adjusting the feedback gains locally to match the stiffness variations. This may involve ‘gain scheduling’ or segmented calibration, where the feedback loop parameters (both lateral and vertical) are optimized for each region based on measured compliance.","Recommendations":"1. Segment the scan area and locally calibrate the feedback gains for regions with differing stiffness.\n2. Use an adaptive control algorithm that dynamically adjusts gains (gain scheduling) during scanning.\n3. Optimize scan speed to allow the feedback loop enough time to react in softer regions.\n4. Regularly verify cantilever calibration and lateral scanner response to ensure accurate gain settings."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-04-22T22:28:42.357813Z","updated_at":"2025-04-23T20:20:32.544146Z","inner_id":99,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":7,"updated_by":7,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":100,"annotations":[{"id":101,"completed_by":7,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["5 - Very Good ✅"]},"id":"jBg-cbV850","from_name":"answer_rating","to_name":"answer_text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-04-23T20:21:13.989677Z","updated_at":"2025-04-23T20:21:13.989694Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":40.347,"prediction":{},"result_count":1,"unique_id":"45f096fa-97f4-48e5-9d0c-11d4963dc7bc","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":100,"project":7,"updated_by":7,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"98ac3348-responses_from_gpt-o3-mini.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"idx":49,"Question":"When scanning a sample with periodic nano-patterns, I notice inconsistent tracking across similar features.

Resonance may amplify vibrational artifacts, while inadequate feedback settings may delay the tip’s response over rapid topography changes, leading to tracking errors.","Recommendations":"1.
