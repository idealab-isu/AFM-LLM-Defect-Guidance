        "Question": "How can I determine if a drop in resolution is due to tip wear vs tip contamination, and what are the cleaning or replacement protocols?",
        "Answer": "Differentiating between tip wear and contamination involves assessing the nature of the resolution loss. Tip wear typically results in gradual resolution degradation and a flattened tip apex, reducing sharpness over time. Contamination, however, often causes a more abrupt resolution decrease, potentially with asymmetric image artifacts or 'streaking' in the scan direction if the contamination is asymmetrically distributed on the tip. Sometimes, you can compare the performance of the tip with a reference sample that you know well. If the resolution is poor on the reference sample, it is likely a tip issue.",

Higher speeds can lead to tracking errors, where the tip cannot properly follow the surface topography, resulting in distorted or inaccurate images.

        "Answer": "When imaging nanostructures with sharp edges, AFM tracking errors arise from the tip's inability to follow steep topographies. This is pronounced in high-aspect-ratio features where the tip struggles to maintain consistent contact or optimal oscillation. Using smaller tip radius, optimizing feedback loop, and decreasing scan speed can help.",

        "Question": "While imaging soft live cells in tapping mode, I see sudden height drops and tracking loss-how can I tune feedback parameters to avoid indentation or disengagement?",
        "Answer": "In tapping mode, sudden height drops during soft sample imaging indicate that the tip is either indenting the sample or losing track of the surface. This is often due to non-optimized feedback parameters. The proportional gain (P) controls how quickly the feedback loop responds to errors, while the integral gain (I) eliminates steady-state errors. If P is too low, the feedback will be sluggish, causing the tip to crash into the surface. If P is too high, the feedback loop will oscillate, leading to instability and potential damage. Similarly, if I is too low, the feedback loop will not be able to maintain the setpoint accurately, leading to inaccurate height measurements. If I is too high, the feedback loop will overcorrect, leading to oscillations and instability.",

        "Answer": "To accurately track sharp topography of protein aggregates at the nanometer scale, your AFM tip should have a small tip radius, typically less than 10 nm, and a high aspect ratio to properly reach the bottom. Choose a cantilever with a high resonance frequency (e.g., >300 kHz) to allow for faster feedback response. Also important is to minimize the free amplitude.",

        "Answer": "Substrate compliance significantly affects AFM tracking stability, especially in liquid environments. Soft substrates can deform under the tip force, leading to unstable feedback loops as the cantilever oscillates or deflects excessively trying to maintain setpoint.

This is further complicated by the probe's potential interaction with the sidewalls of the pores, which can introduce lateral forces and instability.",

        "Answer": "When imaging stiff samples in intermittent contact mode, a higher cantilever spring constant can improve tracking stability. This is because the higher spring constant provides a stronger restoring force, allowing the tip to quickly respond to surface features and maintain consistent intermittent contact. However, excessive spring constant can lead to increased tip wear and potential sample damage. An optimized spring constant enhances the feedback loop's ability to maintain a stable oscillation amplitude and setpoint, crucial for accurate topographic imaging.",

        "Question": "My sample is mounted at a slight tilt-how can uneven loading lead to lateral tip displacement and tracking defects?",
        "Answer": "When the sample is tilted, the AFM tip's movement across the surface becomes asymmetrical. On the higher side of the tilt, the tip experiences greater loading force due to the reduced distance. Conversely, the lower side experiences less force. This uneven force distribution can cause the tip to displace laterally, as it's pulled more towards the higher side where the force is greater. This lateral displacement compromises the tip's ability to accurately follow the surface contours, leading to tracking defects.",
