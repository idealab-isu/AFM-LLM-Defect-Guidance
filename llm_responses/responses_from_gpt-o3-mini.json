        "Answer": "Tip contamination typically results in reversible resolution losses due to adsorbed particles or residues on the tip, whereas tip wear leads to a permanent broadening and rounding of the tip apex that degrades resolution. Examine high-resolution images, especially of calibration standards, for asymmetry or changes in apparent tip geometry\u2014if cleaning (e.g., solvent or plasma treatments) restores resolution, contamination is likely; if not, tip wear is probable.",

For example, substrates that are sticky (like certain polymers or surfaces treated with adhesive residues) or that have residual solvents and particulates can transfer contaminants onto the tip. In addition, surfaces that are not uniformly cleaned or treated may lead to debris accumulation that adheres to the tip during scanning.",

A common practice is to gently rinse the tip in a suitable solvent (e.g., high-purity isopropanol or ethanol) followed by rinsing with deionized water to remove residual contaminants. For more stubborn contamination, a brief exposure to UV-ozone or a mild plasma cleaning (if compatible with your tip material) can be used.

        "Answer": "Early signs of organic contamination can be detected by monitoring changes in tip dynamics and imaging artifacts. Specifically, anomalies in resonance frequency, quality factor, and phase lag, along with unexpected variations in force\u2010distance curves, can indicate contamination. Also, imaging a standard calibration sample can reveal a deteriorating tip shape or resolution, suggesting organic buildup.",

        "Answer": "Tip coating plays a crucial role when imaging hydrophobic surfaces. A hydrophilic tip may increase contamination risk by attracting hydrophobic contaminants, leading to unstable and less reproducible force interactions. Therefore, the tip should ideally be modified with a hydrophobic or inert coating to reduce unwanted interactions and adhesion with the sample, thereby minimizing the risk of contamination.",

A typical oxygen plasma protocol involves exposure at approximately 20-50 W for 2-5 minutes, carefully optimized to avoid tip degradation (especially for metal-coated tips). UV-ozone cleaning is an alternative, often performed for 15-30 minutes. Both methods oxidize and remove organic residues while preserving tip geometry if parameters are properly controlled.",

This adsorption not only degrades image quality but can also interfere with force measurements by altering the effective tip geometry and surface energy. The strength of this fouling is often exacerbated by reduced ionic screening in the measurement medium.",

Typically, after deposition the sample should be gently rinsed with filtered, deionized water to remove non-specifically bound proteins, followed by a rinse with the imaging buffer that matches the conditions used during AFM scanning. This two-step rinse minimizes residual protein in the liquid, thereby reducing the risk of tip fouling during imaging.",

        "Answer": "In tapping mode on soft live cells, sudden height drops and tracking loss can indicate that the feedback loop isn\u2019t reacting quickly or accurately enough to large, soft topographical changes. To reduce sample indentation or tip disengagement, you should adjust your setpoint and feedback gains. A slightly higher setpoint (closer to the free-air amplitude) minimizes the tip-sample contact force, while increasing the proportional gain improves the loop response.

For imaging soft, hydrated cells, the force applied by the tip may not be constant because the substrate deforms, making it challenging to maintain a consistent setpoint.

Adjusting the Z-piezo gain and PID parameters can help improve tracking\u2014the key is to balance response speed with stability. In practice, you may need to lower the overall Z-piezo gain to prevent overshooting on steep features while increasing the proportional (P) component to boost the immediate response.

        "Answer": "A cantilever\u2019s spring constant directly influences the force sensitivity and dynamic response in intermittent contact mode. For stiff samples, if the spring constant is too low, the cantilever may not generate sufficient restoring force upon contacting the sample, leading to delayed or inaccurate feedback response. Conversely, an overly stiff cantilever may not deform enough to maintain fine tracking of surface topography, causing abrupt changes in force that can destabilize the tracking loop. Optimizing the spring constant to match the sample stiffness ensures appropriate deflection sensitivity, minimizes tip-sample force overshoots, and improves feedback performance.",
