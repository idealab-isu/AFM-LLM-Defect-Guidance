Vibration from the perfusion system can decouple the effective feedback control, resulting in loss of critical tracking stability.","Recommendations":"1. Mount the AFM on a vibration isolation table or use damping platforms to minimize external vibrations.\n2.

Changing the scan direction so that the fast-scan axis is perpendicular to the fiber alignment can reduce the abrupt lateral changes, while engaging a tapping (or engage) mode may improve feedback performance and tip–sample interaction by reducing lateral forces.","Recommendations":"1.

To mitigate this, you can implement adaptive or region-specific gain tuning—adjusting the feedback gains locally to match the stiffness variations. This may involve ‘gain scheduling’ or segmented calibration, where the feedback loop parameters (both lateral and vertical) are optimized for each region based on measured compliance.","Recommendations":"1. Segment the scan area and locally calibrate the feedback gains for regions with differing stiffness.\n2.

Resonance may amplify vibrational artifacts, while inadequate feedback settings may delay the tip’s response over rapid topography changes, leading to tracking errors.","Recommendations":"1.
